If this is the case with AES_KEY (key, iv), RSA will be failed.

```c++
unsigned char aes_key[] = {
  0xed, 0x31, 0xe1, 0xb2, 0x14, 0x12, 0xa3, 0x31, 0x02, 0x47, 0x9c, 0x67,
  0x50, 0xb7, 0x2d, 0xde, 0x58, 0xc0, 0xad, 0x7c, 0x1b, 0x22, 0xe9, 0xf6,
  0xe2, 0x89, 0x2f, 0xf4, 0x74, 0x52, 0x75, 0x61
};
unsigned int aes_key_len = 32;
```

Because the ciphertext that need to be encryped is greater than N of RSA.

```c++
if (bignum_cmp(key->n, tmp) < 0) {
    /* Too large input value for the RSA key modulus */
    goto error;
}
```
